# Cyber Threat Landscape Analysis: A Multi-Dimensional Approach

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global cyberattack patterns using the EUREPOC dataset. We examine the patterns and the evolution of cyber atacks accross different ways: type of attacks, geographic, sectoral and temporal.


**Research Question:**
Are cyber attacks becoming more diverse, or do the same attack patterns keep repeating ?

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Full Analysis
```python
python src/cyber_analysis.py
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

The analysis is organized into 3 main sections:

I. **Motivation**
II. **Data Analysis and Process**
III. **Results and Findings**

Section I provide an overview of the motivation about the project.
Section II is the core of the project. It is divided into 3 subsection: Data preparation, Data exploration and Pattern Analysis. The first subsection includes cleaning the data and make some preliminary work on it. Data exploration includes exploration on the variables of our interest, this includes graphics and tables. Last subsection provide a deeper analysis on the pattern we wanted to study, with metrics and visualization.
Section III wrap up the previous work of section I and II and provides a final analysis and a conclusion of the project.
